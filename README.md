# AngularJS Test

This is a tiny project implementing an angular directive wrapper for blueimp jQuery-File-Upload and video uploading to my Wistia account. To keep it simples (for "fast and furious" development) everything is bundled together within index.html (is this a good approach? no...i know that). Comments? Changelog? Gulp/Grunt? Docker? Man... i want this to be simple :)
